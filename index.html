      <p>Games are complicated. Having just passed 50 years of existance, 
        the landscape for video games has been expanding in the most fascinating way.
      With more and more games coming out with each new Console generation, 
      it begs the question: has anything changed at all over these past 50 years?</p>

      <p>When we look at the history of video games, 
        we often find that like many thing in the computing world, 
        the sucuess of software is tied heavily with the hardware developers have to work with.
      Thus, we find that the history of games sales is inherently tied to the history of game consoles, 
      and there are many events in that history that can examined to know that this is true. 
      Moments like the Console Wars of the 90's between the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis 
      were instrumental to the growth of sales of both consoles and the games that were developed for them.
      This was also the case during the explosive launch of Sony's Playstaion, 
      thanks in part due to it's quality 3D graphics and diverse library of games, 
      outclassing Nintendo's own 3D console, the N64.
      Eventually, Nintendo was able to take back it's top spot with the meteoric rise of the Wii, 
      appealing to more casual audiences and widining the appeal.
      This led to more innovation once the PS4 and Xbox One launched and included more casual features like online streaming services,
      leading these two consoles becoming the rivals in the new Console War.
      
      So what is the key to the growth of video games? It's competition.</p>

      <h1>Distributions of Games per Genre</h1>

      <p>Of course, like the history of most things in our world, 
        the history of Game Sales can seem extremely magical at times.
        An example of this can be seen in the relationship between game genre and how it effects their sales, 
        which is to say there is none. For a vast majority of games, 
        sales only stay within the 100,000 to million range. Surprisingly, 
        relatively few games are able to exceed that range an hit the heights of 40 million sales at best, 
        and the only developers that have a chance of reaching those heights are the triple-A studios who already got there.
        This often considered the reason why the games industry is so hard to break into, 
        the standard for success is exceeding difficult to reach. 
        In a way, the data alone shows how unpredicatble the world of video games can be.
